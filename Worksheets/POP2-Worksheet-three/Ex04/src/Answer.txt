1. PhoneLauncher script no longer works after setting playGame(String) to private.
2. Why does this happen? A subclass does not inherit the private members of its parent class.
3. What are the minimal changes that you need to make on class
   SmartPhone so that the script still works?
   Answer: Hide the private method by declaring another private method in SmartPhone with same name
   and different method signature, then these can also be used by the subclass.
